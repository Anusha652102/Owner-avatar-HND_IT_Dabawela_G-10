                Welcome to Yara, a tropical paradise frozen in time. As the dictator of Yara, 
                Antón Castillo is intent on restoring his nation to its former glory by any means 
                necessary, with his son, Diego, following in his bloody footsteps. Their oppressive rule has ignited a revolution.
                
                - Play as Dani Rojas, a local Yaran, as you fight alongside a modern-day guerrilla 
                revolution to liberate Yara. Play the full game solo or with a friend in co-op.
                
                - Explore jungles, beaches, and cities on foot, horseback, or in a wide variety of 
                vehicles including boats and Jet Skis as you fight against Castillo’s regime in the most expansive Far Cry to date.
                
                - Feel the thrill of combat with an arsenal of hundreds of weapons alongside
                 helpful amigos like Chorizo the dog and Guapo the gator.
                
                - Enjoy all-new content and features added since launch, including four new special
                 operations, free blockbuster crossover missions, and fan-requested updates such as 
                 New Game Plus, Completionist Aid, an extra-hard difficulty mode, and four new loadout slots.
